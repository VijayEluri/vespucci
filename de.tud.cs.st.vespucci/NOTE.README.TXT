1. All code written using Eclipse-Modelling-Galileo-SR2-i 
	(http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/galileo/SR2/eclipse-modeling-galileo-SR2-incubation-win32.zip)

2. The ecore-model file and related mapping files can be found in de.tud.cs.st.vespucci project inside the folder model.

3. New gmfgen file must be recreated after change happened in ecore, gmfgraph, gmftool, gmfmap files.

4. To create new gmfgen file: right click on gmfmap file -> choose then "Create generator model..."

5. To apply changes in model, mapping file new code should be generated:
	a. Generate model code: Double click on genmodel file -> Right click on node "vespucci model" -> choose "Generate Model Code". 
	b. Generate edit code: Double click on genmodel file -> Right click on node "vespucci model" -> choose "Generate Edit Code". 
	c. Generate editor code: Double click on genmodel file -> Right click on node "vespucci model" -> choose "Generate Editor Code". 
	-
	d. Generate diagram code: Right click on file gmfgen -> choose "Generate diagram code". 

6. To run and test: 
	a. choose "Run" from menu bar -> "Run Configurations..." -> then create a new run configuration.
	!Note: to prevent "out of perm-space" error, extends the VM-argument by adding "-XX:MaxPermSize=256m".
	b. after finishing new eclipse instance call, create a new project with arbitrary name.
	c. there are now available at 3 places to create new Vespucci-Diagram:
	   1. File -> New -> Software Architecture Constraint Diagram.
	   2. File -> New -> Other... -> Software Architecture Constraint Diagram.
	   3. File -> New -> Other... -> Software Architecture Visualization -> Software Architecture Constraint Diagram.
